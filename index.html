    <h3>Java 2D Game: WAR3</h3>
    <p>
	This is the game submitted as part of my java coursework.The game revolves around a soldier fighting against an infiltrator with aided collectible objects such as healthkit and handgrenade as problems.
		At the start of the game I really took a long time to decide what kind of game and design I would like to implement. As we want along the lines of Milestone2, my confidence rose effectlvely.As such I was so quick to learn more outside of the teaching and was able to implement effectlively.
		My confidence with Java and GUI implementation has been further widened due to this coursework.
		It helped me dispelled my fear.
